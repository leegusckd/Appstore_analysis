    "We find a similar pattern in the `Reference` and `Social Networking` columns. The Bible App, the Dictionary.com apps, and Google Translate alone could make up one of the most popular genres in itself. Same with social networking, without the big networking apps like Facebook, Pinterest, and Skype, Social Networking would not be among the very top when it comes to the most popular genres. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the contrary, the `Finance` genre seems to be more evenly distributed in comparison. If a company was to set about creating a free app in the app store, a finance app seems promising. There is a demand for finance apps, and it is not yet dominated by any particular apps in the way other genres are. \n",
    "\n",
    "I would also highlight the `Music` genre in our analysis. This category follows the pattern we observed earlier, where it is dominated by a select few apps. Yet, there is still a strong enough market even outside of the mainstream apps due to the sheer popularity of music apps. Smaller music apps such as ringtone makers and karaoke apps see decent amount of success; not nearly successful as Pandora or Spotify, but enough to make a good profit. \n",

    "In this project, we analyzed data about the most popular apps on the App Store and Google Play. Our goal was to find a genre of apps that we can recommend to a company wanting to create a brand new app. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, I would advise a company to look into the music genre. Even though the popularity of music apps based on their number of installs/reviews is inflated by mainstream music apps, the sheer popularity of the music industry allows for smaller music apps to succeed. People seem to love listening to music, so perhaps we can create an app that will aid people in listening to music. Apps such as song recommenders, tools for making music videos run in the background, or choosing a popular singer/band and making an app about their music would be a couple of ideas. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, I would recommend a health and fitness app. Fitness apps are highly represented in both the App Store and Google Play. People are clearly interested in taking care of their health and fitness, particularly with exercise and calories. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, a game app would be another recommendation. We can't ignore the popularity of games. As we said earlier, they are always at the top of the market regardless of the platform. However, because there are so many mobile games out there already, we would have to make sure that our game is unique and enjoyable. Perhaps we can get creative and make a musical game, or even a game that is about health and fitness. The possibilities are endless, but through data analysis we can narrow down those possibilities and make an informed decision based on data. "
